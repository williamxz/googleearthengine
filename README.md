# Google Earth Engine Tutorial

## Prerequisites
- Have a Google Earth Engine account. You will need to apply for access. This may take a day to be approved. Do this using your Stanford account, as you will need a lot of space on Google Drive.
- Set up rclone on scdt.stanford.edu and mount your Google Drive. You will use this to transfer files from Google Drive to atlas.
