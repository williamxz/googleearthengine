## Requirements
- Python 3.X
- Use Google Earth Engine Code Editor if you want to be able to visualize images before downloading them.
- Use Google Earth Engine Code Editor to check the status of your exports (under the Tasks tab). You will be able to see if it ran into errors there as well.
- Use Google Colab if you are exporting many images.
- This code is for example only, it is not guranteed to work for your use case. Most likely, you will need to make modifications.
